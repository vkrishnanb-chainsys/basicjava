Differences between Abstract class and Interface

Abstract Class:
	Can have concrete methods
	Can have constructors
	A class can only extend from one base class {or} one abstract class
	i.e A child class can not extend from 2 or more abstract class
	When a child class is instantiated, then the parent abstract class will also be
	instantiated
	Must be extended
	
Interface:
	Can not have concrete methods
	Can not have constructors
	A class can implement from multiple interfaces
	When the implementer class is instantiated the interface is not instantiated
	Must be implemented
